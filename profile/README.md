<h2>About</h2>
<p>
The previous decade has seen a surge in tools designed to simplify the provisioning of cloud infrastructures, on-premise and dedicated servers. While this development is positive, assembling and configuring these tools remains challenging. This task is time-intensive, requiring substantial expertise in cloud systems, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Linux, cybersecurity, etc.

For many who only require an environment for running a few server-side applications, a VPN, blogs, email servers, and file managers, adhering to best practices and ensuring security can be daunting and time-consuming.

Amadla simplifies this process by automating the establishment of a basic environment suitable for personal use to all-sized businesses. It also helps by abstracting many aspects of setting up applications, servers and cloud infrastructures.
